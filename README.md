# MortgageCalculatorMVC

I've created an ASP.NET MVC(.NET Framework) application to calculate loan payment information.<br />

I've used the database access layer with the local DB and using Sql Server database classes. <br />
The database have separate fields for principle, interest rate, years and monthly payment.
